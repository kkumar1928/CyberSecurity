Network Threats:
- Phishing attack
- ransomware
- ddos attacks
-
-
-

Mitigation Strategies:
- exchange filtering
- education of staff regarding potential phishing threats
- taking offsite backups (e.g. tape, airgaps)
- keeping volatile memory intact - infosec
- AAA for things like RDP and off-site access
- loadbalancing
- dynamic ips

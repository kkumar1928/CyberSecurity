Corporate network:
•	Main HQ 
  o	Domain controller → authenticating different users from different branches
•	Branch offices 
  o	Connect to HQ resources, print server, domain controller
•	Devices out of office 
  o	Connection to the main HQ and resources
  o	Make sure devices have reliable antivirus
  o	Make sure the antivirus can be administrated at one point
  o	Use an agent to deploy an antivirus on all of the devices

Threats:
•	Unauthorized access → domain controller 
  o	Branch offices connecting to HQ using VPN
•	Having different resources on separate servers (domain controller, print server etc) 
  o	In case of failure on one server, the other servers with their resources will keep running

Steps to take:
  -	Create packet tracer application, make sure it’s fully working
  -	Write up documentation based on the working packet tracer application
